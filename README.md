## 🛠️ Development & Deployment Workflow
1. **Initialize Engine**: `npm install`
2. **Local Debugging**: `npm run dev` (Port 3004 default)
3. **Accuracy Audit**: `npm test` (**89 Cases must pass before any push**)
4. **Style Verification**: `npm run lint` (**Strict zero-tolerance for errors**)
5. **Production Build**: `npm run build`
6. **Deploy**: Deploy as a static export to cPanel or any high-performance static hosting.

## 📈 SEO & Growth Best Practices
- **JSON-LD Schema**: Every tool (`Calculator.tsx`) includes a `JsonLd` component for search engine snippets.
- **Dynamic Crumbs**: All tools use the `crumbs` array in `CalcWrapper` for local categorization.
- **FY-Persistence**: Routes are timeless (e.g., `/nepal-income-tax`) while content is updated annually in `src/data/`.

---

## 🛡️ Security & Privacy
- **Zero-Storage**: No user data (Taxable income, health data, loan amounts) is stored on our servers.
- **No-Eval Policy**: Native `eval()` is strictly prohibited; all math is piped through the secure parser.
- **SSL Performance**: Fully optimized for HTTPS and Asia-Oceania regional caches.
